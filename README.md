# Lancelot: Cart Knight - Secure E-Commerce Website

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for a secure e-commerce website designed to serve the local community. The project aims to provide a robust, user-friendly, and secure platform for individuals and businesses in the region to engage in e-commerce activities. The implementation adheres to cybersecurity best practices to ensure the safety and privacy of users' data.

## Features

- Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Encrypted communication protocols to protect sensitive information during transmission.
- Robust data validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Implementation of secure coding practices to mitigate the risk of common cyber attacks.
- Regular security assessments and vulnerability scans to identify and address potential threats.
- Comprehensive documentation detailing security protocols and measures implemented.
- 
## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CalebH18/Cart-Knight.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Cart-Knight`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install` and `npm install bcrypt`
4. Configure the environment variables required for the project.
5. Add your database by adding the URL to a .env file: 'DATABASE_URL="*Your Database Link*"'
6. Run the application: `npm start`

## Usage

In this section, we will go over the way to navigate the site giving full explanations on all the features. Be sure to include screenshots here for anything complicated and text to accompany the pictures. 

## Security Measures

In this section, we will write about the security protocol considered and their countermeasures:

- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Encryption protocols for data protection
- Measures to prevent common cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Regular security assessments and vulnerability scans

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
